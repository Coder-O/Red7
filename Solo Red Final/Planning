Planning document for HW 4, DELETE bEBFORE SUBMISSOION
(actually prob don't need to but I should if there is no value in keeping it.)


Do I need to change the interface of a gmae model, as it now exhibits behavior different from its
documentation?

Pros/Cons to inheritance:
+ Easier to reuse code.
+ Access to deck and hand
X I see no way to modify the hand using composition
---- ACTUALLY, CAN GET
... noo I can't...
Wait,
I CAN STORE A 'CORRECT' HAND IN MY NEW CLASS, AND UPDATE IT WITH gatHand() OF THE COMPOSED OBJECT!!!
Wait, that doesn't really fix things, as I still have to find a way to play from the hand using the
old methods...


Pros/cons to Composition:
+ Less likely to break if an implementation of it's predecessor is changed or removed.
- It is hard to access and change the deck
0 This option seems less risky, especially since I don't need to change most of the inner workings
+++++ I DO THIS!!!!!
Could have like a 'buffer' zone, where the hand is still internally represented the same, but the
new class just keeps track of how many cards at the end it shouldn't show...
Maybe the new hand is just the whole deck??
Nah... then you get problems with having everything shift down automatically.


Different representations



Make sure card uses two enums
